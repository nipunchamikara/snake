# Snake

Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. 

The snake is controlled using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right). 

The task is to collect 'food' and avoid hitting itself or the surrounding wall. On collecting food, the length of the snake is incremented and score increased.

A rudimentary menu is provided with basic functionality like starting a new game and quiting. 
Difficulty of the game can be changed.
Hitting escape can pause or resume gameplay.

## Getting Started

In order to run the game, LÖVE, a framework used to make 2D games in Lua has to be installed into your system by following the [link](https://love2d.org/).

During installation, be sure to create a desktop icon as this will make it easier to run LÖVE games.

## Running the game

The game can be run by dragging the folder containing the game into the LÖVE desktop icon.
It can also be run by using the `love` bash command, for example:
```
love <name_of_directory>
```

Note: the directory must contain the **main.lua** file

## Built With
